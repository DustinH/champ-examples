# champ-examples

A collection of examples to help you get started with [champ](https://github.com/lukevenediger/champ), the static site generation tool. You can view
the source on github or download the source and play with it yourself. To re-generate the output, execute
*run.bat* inside each example directory. All generated pages are saved to the output/ directory. Feel free to
contribute your own examples to help others get started quickly.

## More Examples

You can check out the source for my site, http://lukevenediger.me/ which provides a comprehensive example
of using champ with bootstrap, lists, menus, nested pages and so on. As I find time I'll add more concrete
examples of each feature to the list above.
